# Cakery

Team CodeMIND's project for HackTU 5.0 hackathon at Thapar University, Patiala

## Description

Cakery is an online platform revolutionizing bakery shopping.
With a focus on personalization and real-time visualization,
users can easily customize cakes with diverse flavors, designs, and sizes.
Our platform integrates live 3D modeling features,
allowing customers to visualize their creations before ordering.

## Problem Statement

Traditional bakery shopping experiences often lack personalization and real-time visualization,
which can limit customers' choices and create uncertainty about the final product.
The absence of diverse customization options, coupled with the challenge of estimating cake sizes,
presents hurdles to a seamless experience.
Our project aims to address these issues by offering a user-friendly web platform that enables customers
to customize cakes with a wide array of flavors, designs, and sizes.
Additionally, our platform will facilitate order-based interactions,
allowing customers to design and post their cake requests.
Bakeries registered on our platform can then post offers to make the cakes, specifying their price and delivery time.
This innovative approach gives users more freedom of choice while providing bakeries with opportunities to
independently secure orders from our platform, thereby revolutionizing the traditional bakery shopping experience.
Through the incorporation of live 3D modeling features, customers can visualize their creations in real-time,
enhancing the ordering process and eliminating uncertainties.
Additionally, our platform provides access to unique designs through templates,
streamlining the ordering process and further empowering users and bakeries alike.
